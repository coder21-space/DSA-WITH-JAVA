# Java DSA Practice 🚀

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice in **Java**, following **Apna College Sigma 7.0** and other standard resources.  
The structure is organized *topic-wise* for clean learning and quick revision.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
✅ Basics  (progress ongoing)

## 📆 Progress Log
- **Day 1:** java programming setup ,flowchart ,pesudocode & basic hello world
- **Day 2:** basic java programing ,variable & data type 
- **Day 3:** still stick to basic ,operators
- **Day 4:** still basic question(i know maybe its look to slow but turst me my comeback too stronger)
- **Day 5:** conditional statement problem ,finally little bit logical question we started
- **Day 6:** complete conditional staetement playlist
- **Day 7:** start loops concepts basic


## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub 

## pending work
1) variable and data type :-type convertion ,type casting ,type promotion expression
2) operator:- questions not solved fully 
3) loops playlist not finished
